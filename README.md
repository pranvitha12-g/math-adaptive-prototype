# 🧮 Math Adventures — Adaptive Learning Prototype

An AI-powered math learning system that adjusts puzzle difficulty based on user performance.

## 🎯 Objective
Build a simple adaptive math app for children (ages 5–10) that:
- Generates arithmetic puzzles
- Tracks accuracy and time
- Changes difficulty dynamically
- Summarizes session results

## ⚙️ Modules
- `main_app.py` – runs the app  
- `puzzle_maker.py` – creates problems  
- `performance_tracker.py` – tracks progress  
- `adaptive_logic.py` – adjusts difficulty  

## ▶️ Run
```bash
cd src
python main_app.py
